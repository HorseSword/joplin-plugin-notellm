# Features

- **Customizable LLM Service Source**: 
    - Configure the source of your Large Language Model (LLM) service, including options like `openai`, `deepseek`, `qwen`, or even a local LLM server that is compatible with `openai-api`, for example ollama. Configuration requires specifying a URL, API key, and model name.
    - You can find examples in 'Usage Instructions' part below.
- **Chat**: 
    - **If no selection**: Chat with LLM on texts **all above cursor**. All texts after cursor will **not** be sent to LLM.
    - **If any texts are selected**: only selected texts will be sent.
    - New feature: "Advanced Chat Mode". Split texts into pieces like {"role":"user","content":"xxx"}.
- **Summarization**: 
    - **If no selection**: Summarize **all above cursor**.
    - **If any texts are selected**: Summarize selected text portions efficiently. 
- **Rewrite your selection**: 
    - Rewrite selected text. This will consider context before and after selection. 
    - You can tell LLM how to rewrite it.
- **Question & Answer**: 
    - Ask LLM about selected texts.
- **MCP Supported**:
    - You can use streamableHTTP MCP tools in your note.  

## Mobile Support

Currently, mobile users can enjoy the chat functionality over the entire note text. 

Others functions are under development.

**Known problems on mobile app**:
- On mobile app, some LLM servers may not function properly due to **CORS restrictions**. It is known that ollama and MCP have this issue on mobile; you can try configuring a proxy to resolve it. This is **restricted by Joplin framework** and I can not fix it now.
- Sometimes, when you click on a plugin icon, there is no response. Killing the app's background process and restarting the app usually resolves this issue. The cause may be related to Joplin's background management, though I am unable to pinpoint the exact problem at this time.

Then, you will have access to several features. First, a chat icon appears at the top of the markdown editing interface. Clicking on it triggers a conversation with AI based on all preceding content up to your cursor position.

You can also stop generation by click this button again (>= v0.6.1).

And, in the top menu under Tools / NoteLLM, find quick access to all functions. Some have shortcut keys for easy invocation.

## MCP support !!!

MCP functionality has been completely upgraded and restructured, now directly supporting streamableHTTP MCP.

In version v0.7.0 or above, MCP settings can be found in session "NoteLLM MCP". In which you can configure at most 42 MCP servers, and toggle them as you like.

Here you can add streamableHTTP MCP servers.

After changing "MCP for LLM (preview)" from "OFF" to "MCP (tool call)" below LLM1, LLM2 and LLM3, you can use MCP tools in your note now. 

**Reminder: LLM must support "tool call"**.

**Reminder**: STDIO and SSE are NOT supported for now, but you can load them with other tools like "Local_MCP_Manager" and convert them to streamableHTTP mode for invocation. For details, see https://github.com/horsesword/local_mcp_manager
